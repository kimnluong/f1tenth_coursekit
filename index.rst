f1tenth - course kit
================================================

Welcome to the official course kit documentation of `F1tenth <http://f1tenth.org/>`_. 

Here, you will find all the information needed to get your own f1tenth course running at your institution.

This is not a public documentation as it contains solutions to the labs.

There are three parts to this documentation.

#. :ref:`Course Overview <doc_overview>` gives a brief overview of what the class is about and a snapshot of the materials that are presented. It also details the prerequisities needed.
#. :ref:`Lectures <doc_lecture_intro>` contains lecture materials (recordings and slides).
#. :ref:`Labs <doc_labs_intro>` has lab handouts and solutions.

For files of the f1tenth logo, see :ref:`Press <doc_logos>`
